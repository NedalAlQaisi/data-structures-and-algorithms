# Stacks and Queues

Stack and Queues are data structures that follow different patterns the Stack has a vertical shape FILO/LIFO and  the Queues has horizontal FIFO/LILO

# Challenge

The challange asked us to add (push, pop, peak, isEmpty) For the Stack class and (enqueue, dequeue, peak, isEmpty) For the Queue.

# Approach & Efficiency

## Stack time complexity

`push()` Space & Time complexity of BigO (1) 

`pop()` Space & Time complexity of BigO (1) 

`isEmpty()` Space & Time complexity of BigO (1)

`peak()` Space & Time complexity of BigO (1) 

## Queue time complexity

`enqueue()` Space & Time complexity of BigO (1) 

`dequeue()` Space & Time complexity of BigO (1) 

`peak()` Space & Time complexity of BigO (1) 

`isEmpty()` Space & Time complexity of BigO (1)
